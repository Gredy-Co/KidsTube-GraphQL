# 🎥 KidsTube - Safe Video Platform for Children

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**KidsTube** is a web platform designed for parents to control and manage what video content their children are allowed to watch. Videos can be added from YouTube or uploaded directly by the parent, ensuring a secure and curated experience for kids.

This platform is built following a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**, integrating RESTful services for standard functionality and GraphQL for advanced querying. The app also integrates with third-party services like YouTube, Twilio, and MailerSend.
